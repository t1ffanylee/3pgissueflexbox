    <h1>What Can We Do?</h1>
    <h3>1. School administrators and educators need to implement bullying prevention programs, and they need to pay attention to the mental-health needs of their students.</h3>
    <p>Students who feel like they matter—that they are important or significant to others—are less likely to feel isolated, ostracized, and alone. They feel confident that there are people to whom they can turn for support. </p>
    <h3>2. More needs to be done to keep guns out of the hands of youth in America.</h3>
    <p> Most of the perpetrators of K-12 shootings are under the age of 18 — they cannot legally acquire guns. But handguns were used in over 91% of the K-12 shootings, and almost half of the shooters stole the gun from a family member.</p>
    <h3>3. Students, staff, and parents must pay attention to explicit signals of an imminent threat.</h3>
    <p>Many shooters leak information about their plans well before the shooting. Educators and administrators need to encourage reporting among students, even anonymously, and need to take those reports extremely seriously. </p>
    <h3>4. School leaders should be aware that not every apparent act of prevention is worth the costs. </h3>
    <p>Students may also become habituated to the drills, failing to recognize the seriousness of an actual threat should it arise. Additionally, most K-12 shooters are students within the school itself. </p>

  <h1>Observations of School Shooters</h1>
  <h3> There is NO profile of a student who will cause harm. Any attempt to develop profiles of school shooters is an ill-advised and potentially dangerous strategy. Profiling risks wrongly including many children who would never consider committing a violent act and wrongly excluding some children who might.</h3>
  <h3> Certain commonalities behind school shootings: <br>
    - majority of school shooters are male 95% and white 61% <br>
    - history of rejection and many experience bullying </h3>
    <h3> More than half of K-12 shooters have a history of psychological problems (e.g., depression, suicidal ideation, bipolar disorder, and psychotic episodes)</h3>
    <h3> Many shooters also display a fascination with guns and/or a preoccupation with violence. They play violent video games, watch violent movies, and read books that glorify violence and killing. Several of the shooters showed a particular fascination with Columbine, Hitler, and/or Satanism. They wrote journals or drew images depicting violence and gore. </h3>
